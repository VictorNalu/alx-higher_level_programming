# 0x0C. Python- Almost a circle

## Tasks

I learnt about json serialization and deserialization and also, unittesting and it's implementation to be able to solve the tasks in this project. Knowledge of args/kwargs(*args/**kwargs)* was also required.

In the project, we also reviewed all we've learnt in python so far:

> Import
> Exceptions
> Class
> Private attribute
> Getter/Setter
> Class method
> Static method
> Inheritance
> Unittest
> Read/Write file
